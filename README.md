# Welcome to the 3D Unity Game Rpository

This repository contains work by [Stephen Clark](https://github.com/Clarksj4) and [Nick Mowat](https://github.com/Jagerbombzz) for their final year project at Otago Polytechnic. The associated [wiki](https://github.com/Clarksj4/RPGCampaign/wiki) contains a description and reflection on several contributions made to the project during semester 2 by me: Stephen Clark.
